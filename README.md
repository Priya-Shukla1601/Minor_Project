**Smart CarbonTrack**- Digital Monitoring and Reduction of carbon footprint for manufacturing unit

*Project Description*
Smart CarbonTrack is a digital system designed to monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint of manufacturing units. The project enables companies to track carbon emissions generated from energy consumption, production processes, and operational activities through a centralized digital platform. By providing clear visual insights and emission data, the system helps manufacturing units identify major sources of emissions and supports informed decision-making for reducing environmental impact and improving sustainability.
