***Smart CarbonTrack- Digital Monitoring and Reduction of carbon footprint for manufacturing unit***

**Project Description**
Smart CarbonTrack is a digital system designed to monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint of manufacturing units. The project enables companies to track carbon emissions generated from energy consumption, production processes, and operational activities through a centralized digital platform. By providing clear visual insights and emission data, the system helps manufacturing units identify major sources of emissions and supports informed decision-making for reducing environmental impact and improving sustainability.

**Objectives**
-To digitally monitor the carbon footprint of manufacturing units
-To calculate carbon emissions from energy usage and production activities
-To identify major sources contributing to carbon emissions
-To support strategies for reducing the overall carbon footprint
-To promote sustainable and environmentally responsible manufacturing practices.

**Proposed Solution**
-Develop a digital platform to monitor carbon emissions of manufacturing units
-Collect operational data related to energy consumption and production processes
-Track emission trends over time for continuous monitoring
-Provide insights and recommendations to reduce carbon emissions
-Support sustainable decision-making and environmental compliance
